Simple game that populates multiple arrays with values. 

These values are then used by ellipses that bounce around on the screen. For loops
are used to determine which ellipse receives which value stored in each array. 

If the mouse is pressed whilst within the perimiter of any of the ellipses, then the
ellipse is transported off screen. 

Any time an ellipse is clicked on, a set of simple equations calculate the 'points' 
gained and add them to the users 'score' which is displayed on screen.

If all balls have been sucessfully clicked on, 'Game Over' will be displayed on the 
screen.
