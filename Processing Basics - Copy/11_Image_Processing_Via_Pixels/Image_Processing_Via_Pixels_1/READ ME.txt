Loads up an image from the 'data' folder. Loads each pixel from the image and
seperates the r, g, b values into individual floats. Each pixel is then reconfigured
with an altered colour function. In this particular example, each pixel has had their
green and red values swapped, and the blue value has been doubled. 

The pixels are then updated with their new configuration. 

Note that the pixels are stored in an index, not as coordinates. In order to find the 
respective coordinates of each pixel by looking at the index we use this formula;

x + (y * width)
