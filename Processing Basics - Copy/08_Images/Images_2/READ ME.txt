Creates an array of balloons that float up to the top of the screen and then stop 
when they hit the ceiling. There are four balloons and each one has a chance to 
spawn. 

This is the first time I have used a class. In this sketch a class is created to 
encapsulate the basic members that each balloon possesses.
