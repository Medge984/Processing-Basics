For this sketch I wanted to flip the image around the y-axis. In order to do this I 
used pen and paper to design an equation that could take a pixels location and find 
the location that mirrors it around y = width/2.

The line of code in the sketch is this. 
int flip = (width - (x + 1)) + (y * width);
